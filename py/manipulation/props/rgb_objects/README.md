# RGB-objects &#128721;&#129001;&#128311; for robotic manipulation

This folder provides the RGB-objects introduced in the paper [Beyond Pick-and-Place: Tackling Robotic Stacking of Diverse Shapes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=U0Q8CrtBJxJ) and related code used by the 
[RGB-Stacking][rgb_stacking] environment.

## Basic method to create parametric objects {#parametric}

<section class="zippy open">
RGB-objects are a set of parametric objects that were carefully designed to pose
different degrees of grasping and stacking difficulty for a parallel gripper on
a robotic arm.

The basic method used to create objects is applying an extrusion
on a convex 2D shape to produce 3D object. An extrusion is simply pushing the
2D shape into the third dimension by giving it a depth. Both the extrusion
and the 2D shapes are described parametrically. The result of
using variouos 2D shapes and applying different extrusions is a comprehensive
set of 3D objects for robotic manipulation.

Set of feasible parameters to create 3D shapes is described by parameters
bounded by min-max values. In addition, such boundaries can also be expressed
with respect to other parameters.

Nine parameters are currently used:

1.  **`sds`: integer scalar [-]**. The number of edges used to
  generate the regular 2D shape. By default, every 2D shape is a regular one,
  which means that it has equal sides and equal angles.

2.  **`shr`: real-valued [%]**. The percentage of 'shrinking' applied to the 2D
    shape. In the 2D plane, the shape is y-shrunk along the x-axis according to
    the formula: $$ y_{new} = (1 - \mbox{shr} \cdot x)*y_{old} $$.

3.  **`drf`: real-valued [deg]**. The amount of
    [draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_\(engineering\)) used in the
    extrusion. Not used in this dataset, drf=0 for every object

4.  **`hlw`: real-valued [%]**. The percentage of material to be removed from
    each of the generated faces of the solid (to make it hollow). In this dataset,
    no hollow object was created by this transformation, hlw=0 for every object.

5.  **`shx`: real-valued [deg]**. The solid angle of the extrusion axis along
    the x-axis.

6.  **`shy`: real-valued [deg]**. The solid angle of the extrusion axis along
    the y-axis.

7.  **`scx`: real-valued [mm]**. The global x-scale.

8.  **`scy`: real-valued [mm]**. The global y-scale.

9.  **`scz`: real-valued [mm]**. The global z-scale.

The values of these parameters are constrained in such a way that each valid
RGB-shape has a one-to-one mapping with the associated parameters.

## STL assets
<section class="zippy open">
Under the [`meshes`][meshes_dir] directory there are 152 STL files representing
the RGB-object dataset.

### Assets directories structure
All mesh assets are located in the [`meshes`][meshes_dir] directory where they
are further split between following subdirectories:

- [`train`][meshes_train_dir] directory with 103 objects.
- [`test_triplets`][meshes_test_dir] directory with 13 objects including the
  seed `s0`, to form 5 test triplets.
- [`heldout`][meshes_heldout_dir] directory with 36 objects.

### File name convention
All asset files are in [STL format][STL format] and have `*.stl` extention. The
file name starts with an object name and is followed by a sequence of
transformations applied to the seed object.

For example, `b3_sds4_shr48_drf0_hlw0_shx0_shy0_scx46_scy49_scz63.stl` is `b3`
object created by a specific parameterization. For the meaning of
transformations, see [parametric objects](#parametric) above. It is easy to
decode from the first parameter `sds4` that the basic 2D shape was a square
(perfect 2D shape with 4 edges).

Name of the object, eg. 'b3' above, starts from an alphabetic keys ('b')
followed by one or two axes of transformation (axis 3).

### Visualizing STL assets
[`meshlab`][meshlab] is a convinient tool to work with the provided meshes. To
load a mesh from a command line:

```bash
$ cd props/rgb_objects/assets/rgb_v1/meshes
$ meshlab test_triplets/b3_sds4_shr48_drf0_hlw0_shx0_shy0_scx46_scy49_scz63.stl
```

## RGB-objects dataset for manipulation tasks

Using the parametric method described above for object generation, we created a
dataset provided in this directory. It contains mesh assets and supporting
Python code.

For the following discussion, `set` is a collection of objects combined by some
characteristics, and `triplet` is an ordered set of 3 objects with assigned
red, green and blue colors. Triplets are an integral part of the
[RGB-stacking][rgb_stacking] task.

### The RGB-objects family
The technical recipe to create an RGB-object using a 2D shape extrusion, was
described in [parametric objects](#parametric). Specific choices of parameters
were dictated by following approach to design the whole RGB-objects set.
The all instantinated RGB-objects are obtained by applying a certain deformation
to a cube (the seed object).
We have defined six major axes of deformation of the seed object, which result
in different shapes. These shapes can also be thought of as the vertical
extrusion of a 2D shape along different axes which are:

- **Polygon** (axis no.2 in code): deformation obtained by transforming the
  extruded planar shape (i.e. the square) into a regular polygon.
- **Trapezoid** (axis no. 3 in code): deformation obtained by progressively
  morphing the planar square to a isosceles trapezoid.
- **Parallelogram** (axis no. 5 in code): deformation obtained by changing the
  orientation of the extrusion axis, from vertical (i.e. orthogonal to the plane
  of the planar shape) to progressively more slanted axes.
- **Rectangle** (3 deformations, numbered 6, 7, 8): deformation by uniformly
  scaling the object along the X, Y or Z-axis.

These deformations and their combinations define a parametric family of objects.
For our task we designate the axes of all pairwise combined deformations as the
"training axes" and the ones of single deformation as the held-out axes.

The training axes are Polygon & Trapezoid, Polygon & Parallelogram,
Polygon & x-Rectangle, Trapezoid & Parallelogram, Trapezoid & x-Rectangle,
Trapezoid & y-Rectangle, Trapezoid & z-Rectangle, Parallelogram & x-Rectangle,
Parallelogram & y-Rectangle, Parallelogram & z-Rectangle,
and x-Rectangle & y-Rectangle. Pairwise mixing of some of the major axes leads to
objects that are duplicates and therefore we omitted certain axes and objects.
Also note that the x-, y-, z- Rectangle axes are the same so we refer to these
as a single major Rectangle axis.

Based on these 15 axes, we created a training object set, which consists of 103
different shapes, and a held-out set. The diagram below shows a depiction of
all the objects in the dataset.

In the diagram below, the RGB-objects grouped according to each of the 15
chosen axes of deformation. The seed object is at the center; all the other
objects are the result of deformations of this cube. These deformations change
the grasping and stacking affordances of the objects. The held-out objects
(major axes) are enclosed in the uper teal sector; the training objects (pairwise
mixing of two major axes) are enclosed in the blue sector. Some objects cannot
be grasped with a parallel gripper with 85 mm aperture (i.e. the Robotiq 2F-85);
these objects are transparent and were omitted in our experiments.

## Usage example
<section class="zippy open">
RGB-objects are implemented in [`props/rgb_objects`][rgb_object_package] package,
  can be initialized and used as following.


```python
from dm_robotics.manipulation.props.rgb_objects import rgb_object

 color_set = [
      [1, 0, 0, 1],  # RED
      [0, 1, 0, 1],  # GREEN
      [0, 0, 1, 1],  # BLUE
  ]

# Only a name of the object and its color are required. Optional parameters
# include scaling, mass etc.
prop_1 = rgb_object.RgbObjectProp(obj_id='r3', color=color_set[0])
prop_2 = rgb_object.RgbObjectProp(obj_id='g2', color=color_set[1])
prop_3 = rgb_object.RgbObjectProp(obj_id='b1', color=color_set[2])

# A list of all available objects could be accessed with
ids_list = rgb_object.RGB_OBJECTS_FULL_SET

```

Objects could be created individually as in the above snippet. Alternatively,
some object triplets have been defined in `rgb_object.PROP_TRIPLETS`.

```python
object_set = 'rgb_test_triplet1'
_, obj_ids = rgb_object.PROP_SETS[object_set]
task_props = []
for i, obj_id in enumerate(objects):
  prop = rgb_object.RgbObjectProp(
        obj_id=obj_id, color=color_set[i], name=f'rgb_object_{obj_id}')
  task_props.append(prop)
```
